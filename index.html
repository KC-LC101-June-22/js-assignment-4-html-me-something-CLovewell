      <p>Of all the important constants of mathematics, two of the most famous and most useful 
         are the circle constant &pi;, and the base of the natural logarithm, i.e. Euler's number <i>e</i>.
         A third, slightly lesser known constant (and my personal favorite number) is the golden ratio.
         I will attempt in what follows to provide an intriguing and enlightening discussion of this number,
         including how to calculate it, several of its important properties, and how it might naturally
         arise.</p>
      <p>The name "golden ratio" comes from the number's role in aesthetics. The popular contention to make
         upon introducing the golden ratio is that
         this number is somehow optimal as an aspect ratio. 
         That is, if you are an artist and you are making something rectangular, and you must decide how many
         times longer the length is than the width, then you should make the length exactly "the golden
         ratio times longer" in order to maximize the perceived visual pleasantness of your work.
         </p>
         <p>
         What exactly "optimal" or "visual pleasantness" means here is at first unclear;
         obviously different conditions and different tastes will call for different aspect ratios. But there
         is a rigorous and simple mathematical proof that shows that the golden ratio has a certain property
         that no other number has, and which property is undeniably aesthetically pleasing.
      </p>
      <p>
         Suppose we draw a rectangle whose length-to-width ratio is some number 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi> <mo>></mo> <mn>1</mn>
         </math>. 
         Since we are only interested in their ratio and not the actual values of the width and length,
         we can decide to make the width equal to 1. Then the length is equal to 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi>
         </math>. Make a cut
         (or "section") along the width of this rectangle, so that the portion cut off to the left side
         forms a square. Then we must have cut at a distance 1 from the left side of the rectangle. This 
         means the remaining width is 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi> <mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn>
         </math>. See that new, smaller rectangle to the right of the square? 
         Wouldn't it be neat if the ratio of its length and width was <em>also</em> equal to 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi>
         </math>?
      </p>
      <img src="./images/golden_ratio.jpg" alt="A demonstration of the golden ratio">
      <p>
         We can see clearly that the length of the small rectangle is 1 and its width is 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi> <mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn>
         </math>. In order
         for the two rectangles to have the same relative dimensions, &phi; must satisfy the equation
      </p>
      <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
         <mi>&phi;</mi> <mo>=</mo>
         <mfrac>
            <mn>
               1
            </mn>
            <mi>&phi;</mi> <mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn>
         </mfrac>
         .
      </math>  
      <p>
         There is a unique positive number 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi>
         </math> that satisfies this equation. We can find that number
         with a little algebra. You may notice that after multiplying both sides by 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi> <mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn>
         </math> the equation
         is quadratic. Thus the quadratic formula is the most advanced tool we need to find 
         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>&phi;</mi>
         </math>.
